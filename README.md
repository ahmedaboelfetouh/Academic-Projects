My Projects for Bachelor's Degree in CE at ASU 

#1. Security Project 1 : The DES encryption and decryption technique.
#2. Security Project 2 : BlockChain python implementation.
  A blockchain Python application that keeps track of blockchain branches and appends new blocks to the longest branch. In order to append a block, the block contain       64bit nonce that causes the hash to start with N zeros. 
  Each block contains a random list of transactions.
  puzzle hardness by controlled varying N so that the block chain grows at 1 block per second.
  a simulation of an attack that an attacker appears and tries to grow his own branch of the blockchain, by appending to a previous block (not the latest verified         block). 
  The attack speed is a predetermined parameter.
